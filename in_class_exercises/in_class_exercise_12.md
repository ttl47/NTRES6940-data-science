## Questions

Load the gapminder data

``` r
library(gapminder) #install.packages("gapminder")
```

1.  Write a script that loops through the gapminder data by continent
    and prints out whether the mean life expectancy is smaller or larger
    than 50 years.

2.  Modify the script from above to loop over each country. This time
    print out whether the life expectancy is smaller than 50, between 50
    and 70, or greater than 70.

3.  Use an if() statement to print a suitable message reporting whether
    there are any records from 2002 in the gapminder dataset. Now do the
    same for 2012.
